        # Note: Python analysis is currently disabled because Python code
        # is in sus-iot/ directory which is not part of this repository.
        # To enable Python analysis, either:
        # 1. Move sus-iot/ code into this repository, or
        # 2. Set up a separate CodeQL workflow in sus-iot/ repository
